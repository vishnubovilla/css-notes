CSS Outline
----------------
An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, outside the borders, to make the element standout.

CSS has the following outline properties
-----------------------------------------------------
outline-style
outline-color
outline-width
outline-offset
outline

NOTE: outline differs from borders. Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the elements border, and may overlap other content. Also, the outline is not a part of the elements dimensions, the elements total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.

CSS Outline Style
-----------------------
The outline-style property specifies the style of the outline, and can have one of the following values.
dotted
dashed
solid
double
groove
ridge
inset
outset
none
hidden


NOTE: None of the other outline properties will have any effect unless the outline-style property is set.



CSS Outline Width
-----------------------
The outline-width property specifies the width of the outline, and can have one of the following values:
thin (typically 1px)
medium (typicall 3px)
think (typically 5px)
A specific size (in px, pt, cm, em, etc)


The following examples shows some outlines with different widths.

p.ext1{
    border: 3px solid black;
    
    outline-style: solid;
    outline-color: red;
    outline-width: thin;
}

p.ext2{
    border: 1px solid red;
    
    outline-style: dotted;
    outline-color: black;
    outline-width: thick;
}



CSS Outline Color
------------------------
The outline-color property is used to set the color of the outline.



CSS Outline - Shorthand property
--------------------------------------------
The outline property is a short hand property for setting the following individual outline properties:
outline-width
outline-style   (required)
outline-color


The outline property is specified as one, two, or three values from the list above. The border of the values does not matter.

For example:
p.ext1{
    outline: solid;
}

p.ext2{
    outline: dotted red;
}

p.ext3{
    outline: 3px solid red;
}

p.ext4{
    outline: thick dashed green;
}




CSS Outline Offset Property
------------------------------------
The outline-offset property adds space between an outline and the edge/border of an element. The space between an element and its outline is transparent.


The following exmaple specifies an outline 15px outside the border edge.

p{
    margin: 30px;
    border: 2px solid black;
    outline: 2 solid red;
    outline-offset: 15px;
}
