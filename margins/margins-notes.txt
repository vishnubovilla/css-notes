The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

With CSS, you've full control over the margings. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element(top, right, bottom, left)

Margin - Individual Sides

margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left

All the margin properties can have the following values:

auto    -   the browser calculates the margin
length  -   specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc.
%       -   specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element.
inherit -   specifies that margin should be inherited from the parent element.

NOTE: Negative values are allowed.

To shorten the code, it is possible to specify all the margin properties in one property like following.

margin: 25px 50px 75px 100px;
This is same as - 

margin-top: 25px;
margin-right: 50px;
margin-bottom: 75px;
margin-left: 100px;

If the margin property has 2 values - 
margin: 25px 50px;

Top & Bottom margins are 25px and Right & Left margins are 50px;

If the margin property has one value - 
margin: 25px;

all four margins are 25px;



The Auto Value
--------------
You can set the margin property to auto to horizontally center the element within its container.

The element will then take up the specified width, the remaining space will be split equally between the right and left margins.

For example.

div{
    wdith: 300px;
    margin: auto;
    border: 1px solid red;
}




The Inherit value
------------------
This example lets the left margin of the <p class="ex1"> element be inherited from the parent element <div>

example:
div{
    border: 1px solid red;
    margin-left: 100px;
}

p{
    margin-left: inherit;
}




Margin Collapse
---------------
Top and Bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the 2 margins.
This does not happen on left and right margins. It happens for only top and bottom margins.

For example:
h1{
    margin: 0 0 50px 0; //top, right, bottom, left
}

h2{
    margin: 20px 0 0 0;
}


In the example above, the <h1> element has a bottom margin of 50px; and h2 element has a top margin of 20px;
Common sense, would seem to suggest the vertical margin between h1 and h2 elements would be total of 70px (50px + 20px). But, due to margin collapse, the actual margin ends up being 50px;
