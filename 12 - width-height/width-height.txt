The width and height properties are used to set the height and width of an element.

The height and width properties do not include padding, borders, or margins. It sets the height/width of the area inside the padding, border, and margin of the element.

Height and Width Values
---------------------------------
The height and width properties may have the following values - 
auto - default
length - defines the height and width in px, cm, etc.
% - defines the height and width in percent of the containing block.
initial - sets the height and width to its default value.
inherit - the height and width will be inherited from its parent value.

Example:
------------
div{
    height: 200px;
    width: 50%;
    background-color: powderblue;
}


NOTE: The height and width properties do not include padding, borders, or margins. They set the height and width of the area inside the padding, border, and margin of the element.


Setting max-width:
------------------------
The max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.
The max-width can be specified in length values like, px, cm, etc. or in percent (%) of the containing block, or set to none. (This is default, means, there is maximum-width.)

div{
    height: 100px;
    width: 500px;
    background-color: yellow;
}


The problem with the <div> above occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element (500px). The browser then adds  a horizontal scrollbar to the page.

Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows.

NOTE: The value of the max-width property overrides width
